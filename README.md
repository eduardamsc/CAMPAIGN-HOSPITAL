# CAMPAIGN-HOSPITAL 2019/2020

Work developed for my masters' thesis "Analysing Socio-technical Systems Through Social Simulation".

## 'campaignhospital.nlogo' file
The file 'campaignhospital.nlogo' possesses a model in NetLogo intending to simulate the complex socio-technical system of the “hospital de campanha” at “Pavilhão Rosa Mota” so as to test different operating policies to increase its efficiency.

## 'csv files' folder
The folder ´csv files´ contains all the .csv files resulting from running different simulations.
The files names follow the following convention:

>plots + type of case (Average/Worst) + scenario number (1/2/3) + percentage of empathetic medical staff (0/25/50/75/100).

e.g. File plotsAverage20.csv is a file with the data from a simulation considering scenario 2, average case, and 0% empathetic medical staff.

## 'Graphs.xlsx' file
The file 'Graphs.xlsx' shows many different combinations of the information resultant from the .csv files in graphs.

## 'graphs' folder
The folder ´graphs´ contains all the .png files resulting from different combinations of the data resultant from several simulations.
The files names follow the following convention:

>scenario + scenario number (1/2/3/23) + type of case (average/worst) + performance variable (AOR/AWT/AVD/ASVD).

<sub><sup>*23 for combining scenarios 2 and 3</sup></sub>

<sub><sup>*AOR for Average Occupancy Rate; AWT for Average Waiting Time; AVD for Average Visits Duration; ASVD for Average Single Visit Duration.</sup></sub>

e.g. File scenario2averageAOR.png is a graph showing the evolution of the Average Occupancy Rate resultant from a simulation considering scenario 2 in an average case.
