# CAMPAIGN-HOSPITAL 2019/2020

Work developed for my masters' thesis "Analysing Socio-technical Systems Through Social Simulation".

## 'campaignhospital.nlogo' file
The file 'campaignhospital.nlogo' possesses a model in NetLogo intending to simulate the complex socio-technical system of the “hospital de campanha” at “Pavilhão Rosa Mota” so as to test different operating policies to increase its efficiency.

## 'csv files' folder
The folder ´csv files´ contains all the .csv files resulting from running different simulations.
The files names follow the following convention:

>plots + type of case (Average/Worst) + scenario number (1/2/3) + percentage of empathetic medical staff (0/25/50/75/100).

e.g. File plotsAverage20.csv is a file with the data from a simulation considering scenario 2, average case, and 0% empathetic medical staff.

## 'Graphs.xlsx' file
The file 'Graphs.xlsx' shows many different combinations of the information resultant from the .csv files in graphs.
